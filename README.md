# Dice Mocker Bot

_A Discord bot that randomly finds anagrams in text channel messages_

### Instructions

1. Create a text file called `token.txt` containing the secure token for your
   bot account. The bot will read the token from this file rather than keeping
   the token in the source code.

2. Install the required Python library `discord`, for example by
    ```
    $ pip3 install discord --user
    ```

3. You can now start the bot with
    ```
    $ python3 bot.py
    ```
